mov eax, [ebx + ecx*4 + 8]

The above assembly instruction attempts to access memory using the address calculated as `[ebx + ecx*4 + 8]`.  This calculation is susceptible to an integer overflow bug if the values in `ebx`, `ecx`, or the constant 8, when added together, exceed the maximum addressable memory.  If an overflow occurs, the resulting address will be incorrect, leading to unexpected behavior or a program crash (segmentation fault).
